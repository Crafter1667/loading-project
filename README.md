# loading-project
this is a code that makes a cup-shaped loader, based on some instagram profiles
This code is still in testing.
It's an animation for websites made in HTML, and it's being developed by a student to test his skills.
Use at your own risk, I don't know how well it works on websites because I've only tested it myself. You don't need to give credits if you use the code.
Please comment what you think of the code and report errors and bugs.
